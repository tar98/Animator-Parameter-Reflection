# Animator Parameter Reflection
A Unity Editor Tool that create a C# script using a Reflection with in input a list of Animator Controller

___

### Conflict
I had a issues when i work with **Animator Controller**.
In code i usually save the the hash's parameter inside the same class where i have the **Animator Component**, but sometime i need that hash
outside of that class, and i am constrained to make a public variable or a property.
<br>Another issue is when other my colleague create a
new **Animator Controller** without caching the hash's property give me a lot of waste time.
